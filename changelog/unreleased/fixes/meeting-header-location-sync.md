**Meeting Header Location Sync**: Fixed issue where the meeting list header showed the wrong location after searching for a new place
- The "Meetings in [location]" header now correctly updates when using the location search
- Previously, searching for a new location (e.g., Bentonville, AR) would show the previous location (e.g., Kansas) in the header while the map correctly moved to the new area
