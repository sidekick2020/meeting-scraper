**Map-List Interaction Improvements**: Enhanced map and meeting list synchronization
- Hovering over a meeting in the list now highlights and expands the corresponding marker on the map with a pulse animation
- Meeting list is now sorted by distance from the map center, showing closest meetings first
- Marker returns to normal state when hover ends
- Works with both in-person (blue) and online/hybrid (green) markers
