**Consolidated Admin Sources UI**: Complete redesign of the Sources management experience
- New dedicated Sources page with tabbed navigation between Active Sources and Coverage Gaps
- Add New Source button opens a slide-out side panel with 4-step wizard (Discover, Test, Review, Save)
- Coverage gaps now displayed as expandable table rows with detailed analysis and recommendations
- Renamed "Active Sessions" to "Drafts" with searchable dropdown for quick access
- Draft selection prefills the Add Source form with existing data for easy resumption
- Implemented cache-first with Back4app fallback pattern for improved reliability
- Back4app serves as the source of truth for statistics, coverage analysis, sources, and meetings
