**Scraper Progress UI Cleanup**: Redesigned the scraping progress panel for better readability
- Replaced card-based stats with compact horizontal stats row
- Simplified progress section with cleaner typography and gradient progress bar
- Streamlined activity log with minimal dot indicators instead of icons
- Type breakdown chips now only show types with counts > 0
- Compact inline controls replace large button layout
