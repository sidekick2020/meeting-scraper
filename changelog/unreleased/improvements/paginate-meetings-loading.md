**Paginated Meetings Loading**: Improved loading UX with progressive pagination
- Meetings now load 5 at a time for faster perceived loading
- Subtle loading indicator at top of map instead of blocking overlay
- Map automatically zooms to meeting location when clicking a card from the list
- Network-adaptive batch sizes (5-20) for optimal performance
- Filters (Today, Online, Meeting Type) now trigger server-side filtering for complete results
