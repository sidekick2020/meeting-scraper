**Clarify Unsaved Meetings Display**: Added duplicate and error counts to the scraping progress sidebar
- Shows "duplicates" count when meetings are skipped because they already exist in database
- Shows "errors" count when meetings fail to save
- Provides clear visibility into why found meetings weren't saved (duplicates in gray, errors in red)
